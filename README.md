Most LeetCode repos are flat folders of files named after problem numbers. This one is different — it's organized by **algorithmic pattern**, because that's how problems are actually *solved* in an interview: you're never told "this is a DP problem." You have to recognize it.

If you're grinding for **SDE interviews at product-based companies**, this is a study guide, not just an answer key.

## Why pattern-based?

Interviews don't hand you a topic tag. A *"sliding window"* problem, a *"two pointers"* problem, and a *"binary search"* problem can all look superficially alike. The ability that gets you hired is the ability to **map a fresh, weird problem onto a known pattern**.

Each subdirectory here is a studied pattern:

- **All** solutions in a folder share the same recognition heuristic — read any two and the pattern clicks.
- **Difficulty is a by-product**, not the organizing idea. You build up from recognizing a pattern to mastering it.
- **Edge cases are called out explicitly** (empty input, single element, boundaries) — the exact things that decide pass/fail on the judge and in review.

I built this the way you actually study: practice first, notice the recurring shapes, then file each solution under the shape it belongs to.

## Conventions used throughout

- **Iterative over recursive** wherever a clean iterative version exists (stacks/queues instead of recursion for traversal-heavy problems).
- **Bottom-up tabulation** for DP, not top-down memoization — unless the recursive structure is significantly clearer.
- Every file documents its **LeetCode number, difficulty, tags, time complexity, and space complexity** in a header comment.
- **Edge cases** (empty input, single element, boundary values) are handled explicitly, not assumed away.
- Solutions are **self-contained** and named after the problem — no cross-file imports to hunt down.

## Tech stack

- **Java 17**
- **No external libraries** — pure `java.util` (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `ArrayDeque`, `PriorityQueue`, etc.)
- SQL solutions use plain, portable query syntax

## Updates

> **This repository is updated daily** — new solutions are added as problems are solved, keeping the collection consistently fresh and growing.
