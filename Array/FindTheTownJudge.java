/**
 * 997. FindTheTownJudge
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Hash Table, Graph
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
 *
 * Pattern: In-Degree / Out-Degree Counting
 * Key insight: The town judge trusts nobody (out-degree 0) and is trusted by all others (in-degree n-1). A single pass
 * over trust pairs builds both degree arrays; a second pass over candidates finds the unique person satisfying both
 * conditions.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N + E) - One pass over E trust pairs to build degree arrays, one pass over N candidates
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Two integer arrays of size n+1 for in-degree and out-degree
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 with no trust relations (sole person is judge, returns 1), no person satisfies both degree
 * conditions (returns -1), multiple candidates with in-degree n-1 but one has out-degree > 0 (correctly excluded)
