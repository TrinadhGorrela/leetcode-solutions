/**
 * 835. Image Overlap
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Matrix
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/image-overlap/
 *
 * Pattern: Brute-Force Translation Enumeration
 * Key insight: There are exactly (2n-1)^2 possible translations of img1 relative to img2. For each translation, count pixel-wise overlaps in O(n^2), and the maximum across all shifts is the answer. This is fast enough because n <= 30, making the total work ~30^4 ≈ 810K.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n^4) - Two nested loops over O(n^2) shifts, each invoking an O(n^2) overlap count
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a fixed number of integer variables; no auxiliary data structures
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single-pixel images (n=1); images with no overlapping 1s (returns 0); images already perfectly aligned; all-zero or all-one images; shifts that move img1 entirely off img2 (boundary clamping in helper)
