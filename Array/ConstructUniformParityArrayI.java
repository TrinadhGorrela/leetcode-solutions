/**
 * 3875. Construct Uniform Parity Array I
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-uniform-parity-array-i/
 *
 * Pattern: Parity Invariant Argument (Mathematical Proof)
 * Key insight: The answer is always true. The odd-even parity of nums1[i] - nums1[j]
 * equals the XOR of the two parities: it is even iff nums1[i] and nums1[j] share the
 * same parity, and odd iff they differ. Because nums1 has only two parity classes and
 * n >= 1, pick any element as a reference. For each index i, if nums1[i] already has the
 * target parity, keep it as nums1[i]; otherwise subtract a reference element of the
 * opposite parity, which flips it to the target. Since n <= 100 and values are distinct,
 * a suitable j != i always exists, so every index can be driven to a single parity.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - The solution is a constant-time decision; no element of the
 * array is examined to reach the answer.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra space is used.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single-element array (n == 1) - the lone element defines its own
 * parity and is always a valid uniform array; constraints guarantee n >= 1, so empty or
 * null input never occurs under the official problem statement.
