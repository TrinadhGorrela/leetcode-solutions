/**
 * 706. Design HashMap
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Hash Table, Linked List, Design, Hash Function
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/
 *
 * Pattern: Direct-Address Table (Bounded Key Space)
 * Key insight: Keys are bounded to [0, 10^6], so a flat int[1000001] array serves as a perfect hash. Values are stored as value+1 so that 0 maps to index 0 (distinguishing "value 0" from "empty slot" which stores 0 after removal).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) per operation - Direct array index access for put, get, and remove
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Fixed 1000001-element array regardless of how many keys are used
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: storing and retrieving value 0 (offset by +1 avoids ambiguity with the empty marker), removing a key then querying it (returns -1), re-putting the same key with a different value
