/**
 * 287. Find the Duplicate Number
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Bit Manipulation, Pigeonhole Principle, Floyd's Cycle
 * Finding Algorithm
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/
 *
 * Pattern: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Cycle Detection
 * Key insight: Since values are in [1, n], treating nums[i] as "next node" forms a linked list with a cycle — the
 * duplicate is the cycle's entrance, found by moving slow/fast to meet, then resetting one pointer to 0 and advancing
 * both at speed 1.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Phase 1 finds meeting point in O(N), phase 2 finds entrance in O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two pointers only; no hash set or array copy needed
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: duplicate at index 0 (cycle starts at 0), self-loop (nums[i] = i forms a trivial cycle),
 * duplicate appearing 2+ times (still one cycle entrance)
