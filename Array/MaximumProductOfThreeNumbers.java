/**
 * 628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Math, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-three-numbers/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort + Candidate Comparison
 * Key insight: After sorting, the maximum 3-product is either the three largest positives (tail) or the two most-negative values times the largest positive (two negatives yield a positive product).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Arrays.sort dominates with N log N comparison-based sorting
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two local product variables after in-place sort, no extra data structures
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: two large negatives times a positive beats three positives, all-negative arrays, zeros in the middle, exactly three elements (both candidates overlap)
