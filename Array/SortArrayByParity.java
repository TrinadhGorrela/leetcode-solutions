/**
 * 905. Sort Array By Parity
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/
 *
 * Pattern: In-place Bubble-Shift Partition
 * Key insight: Maintain a `left` pointer marking where the next even element belongs; when an even is found, bubble it
 * leftward by swapping adjacent elements until it reaches `left`.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N^2) - Each even element may bubble past all odd elements preceding it (suboptimal; two-pointer
 * swap is O(N))
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place swaps with only left, right, and temp variables
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: all odd (left stays 0), all even (each shifts one position), zeros treated as even, negative
 * evens/odds (parity via modulo)
