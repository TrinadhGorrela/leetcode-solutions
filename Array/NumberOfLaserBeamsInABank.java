/**
 * 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Math, String, Matrix
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/
 *
 * Pattern: Adjacent Non-Empty Row Pairing
 * Key insight: Empty rows between device rows do not generate beams themselves but act as multipliers — only
 * consecutive rows that both have devices contribute `prev × curr` beams, and empty rows are simply skipped without
 * breaking the chain.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(M × N) - M rows, N columns per row; every character is visited once
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two running counters (prev, curr) and an accumulator
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: all rows empty (returns 0), only one non-empty row (returns 0), consecutive non-empty rows (beams
 * = product), interleaved empty rows between device rows (beams skip empties correctly)
