/**
 * 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Math, Prefix Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-even-sum-difference/
 *
 * Pattern: Running Prefix Sum with Parity Check
 * Key insight: leftSum - rightSum = 2*leftSum - total, so the difference is even exactly when total is even — meaning
 * either all N-1 splits are valid or none are. The code still enumerates splits but the parity of the total sum is the
 * decisive factor.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass to compute total, one pass to evaluate each of the N-1 split positions
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only an accumulator for total (long to prevent overflow) and a running left sum
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: odd-length arrays producing no valid split when total is odd, negative values, large sums
 * requiring long arithmetic
