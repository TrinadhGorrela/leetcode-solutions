/**
 * 1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort + Adjacent Difference Check
 * Key insight: After sorting, an arithmetic progression requires a constant difference between every consecutive pair.
 * Compute diff = arr[1] - arr[0] once, then verify all subsequent gaps match it.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting dominates; the subsequent linear scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Sorting is in-place; only a diff variable and loop index are used
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: exactly two elements (always forms a progression), non-uniform gaps after sorting, negative
 * differences between sorted elements
