/**
 * 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Prefix Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
 *
 * Pattern: In-place Prefix Sum
 * Key insight: Each element becomes the sum of all previous elements plus itself, computed by maintaining a single
 * running accumulator and overwriting the array in left-to-right order.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One linear pass accumulating and writing each position exactly once
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - A single int accumulator (sum) is used; the result is written back into the input array
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single element (returned as-is), negative values accumulating to a negative prefix, zeros at the
 * start (prefix remains 0 until first non-zero)
