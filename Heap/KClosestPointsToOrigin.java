/**
 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Math, Divide and Conquer, Geometry, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Quickselect,
 * K-D Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
 *
 * Pattern: Max-Heap (Priority Queue) of Size K
 * Key insight: Maintain a max-heap of size K storing distance-pairs; inserting each point and ejecting the farthest when
 * size exceeds K leaves exactly the K closest. Using a max-heap (descending comparator) ensures the largest distance
 * is at the heap root and is ejected first, which is correct because we want to keep only the K smallest distances.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log K) - Each of N points is inserted/possibly ejected in O(log K) heap operations.
 * Space Complexity: O(K) - The heap holds at most K entries, and the result array is also O(K).
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k equals total number of points (all returned); k == 1 (single closest point); points at origin
 * (distance zero, never ejected); negative coordinates (sqrt of sum-of-squares is always non-negative).
