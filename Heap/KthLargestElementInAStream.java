/**
 * 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Tree, Design, Binary Search Tree, Heap (Priority Queue), Binary Tree, Data Stream
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/
 *
 * Pattern: Min-Heap of Size K (Top-K, Persistent)
 * Key insight: Maintain a min-heap of exactly K elements at all times. On each add(), the new value is inserted and the
 * smallest element is ejected if size exceeds K, so the heap root always equals the Kth largest seen so far. This is
 * exact because ejecting a value smaller than K existing values cannot affect the Kth rank.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(M log K) total across constructor and M add() calls - Each of M insertions costs O(log K); the
 * constructor processes the initial N elements in O(N log K) time.
 * Space Complexity: O(N + K) - The heap holds up to K elements; the initial array is also processed but not retained.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k equals 1 (heap root is the overall largest); initial array smaller than k (all elements kept,
 * the smallest is the Kth largest); all identical values; add() called with very large or very small values.
