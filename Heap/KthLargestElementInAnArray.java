/**
 * 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Quickselect
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
 *
 * Pattern: Min-Heap of Size K (Top-K)
 * Key insight: Maintain a min-heap that holds exactly K elements. As each element is inserted, if the heap grows larger
 * than K the smallest element is ejected; once all elements are processed, the heap root is the Kth largest. This works
 * because ejecting smaller elements guarantees only K largest survive.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log K) - Each of N elements does at most one push and one poll, each taking O(log K) heap
 * operations.
 * Space Complexity: O(K) - The heap stores at most K elements at any time.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k equals array length (heap grows to N; root is the overall minimum); k equals 1 (returns the
 * largest element); array has all equal elements; single element array.
