/**
 * 2390. Removing Stars From a String
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: String, Stack, Simulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/
 *
 * Pattern: StringBuilder as Stack
 * Key insight: Append each non-'*' character to a StringBuilder; on '*', delete the last character (the nearest left neighbor). The StringBuilder naturally acts as a stack with O(1) amortized append/deleteAt-end.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each character appended or removed at most once.
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - StringBuilder holds the surviving characters.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no stars (string unchanged), all stars (empty result), star at the beginning (guarded delete), alternating star/letter pattern
