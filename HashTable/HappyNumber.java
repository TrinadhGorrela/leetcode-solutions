/**
 * 202. Happy Number
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Hash Table, Math, Two Pointers, Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/
 *
 * Pattern: HashSet Cycle Detection
 * Key insight: Replace n with the sum of its digits' squares repeatedly; the sequence must either reach 1 (happy) or enter a cycle (unhappy)—detect the cycle by checking a HashSet of seen values.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) amortized - Digit-square sum shrinks rapidly; cycle detection via set lookup is O(1) amortized.
 * Space Complexity: O(log n) - HashSet stores values along the sequence before cycling.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 (already happy), n = 0, single-digit non-1 (cycle), cycle detected early (returns false immediately)
