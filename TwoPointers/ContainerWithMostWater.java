/**
 * 11. Container With Most Water
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Greedy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
 *
 * Pattern: Greedy Two-Pointer Shrink
 * Key insight: The area is bounded by the shorter wall and the width; moving the taller wall inward can only decrease
 * width without improving height, so always advancing the shorter pointer is provably optimal.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each pointer moves at most N steps; single pass
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two pointers, one max tracker, one temp area variable
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Minimum two-element array, equal heights (either pointer can move), all walls same height,
 * tallest walls at the ends, progressively decreasing heights
