/**
 * 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Two Pointers
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/
 *
 * Pattern: Sorted Dedup via Write Pointer
 * Key insight: The sorted guarantee means a new unique value always differs from nums[i-1]; writeIndex advances only on such transitions, packing unique values contiguously at the front.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass from index 1; each element compared once to its predecessor
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - One read and one write pointer, in-place on input array
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: All identical elements (result length 1), already fully unique (writeIndex reaches N), single-element array, consecutive runs of the same value
