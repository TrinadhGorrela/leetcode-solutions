/**
 * 344. Reverse String
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Two Pointers, String
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
 *
 * Pattern: In-Place Two-Pointer Swap
 * Key insight: Swap s[left] and s[right] then advance both inward; the loop terminates when left >= right, naturally handling both even and odd lengths without separate logic.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - N/2 swaps, each O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - One temp char variable; all swaps happen in the input array
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Empty array (loop never enters), single element (left == right, no-op), even-length (pointers meet between elements), odd-length (middle element stays put)
