/**
 * 881. Boats to Save People
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Greedy, Sorting, Timsort
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort + Greedy Two-Pointer Pairing
 * Key insight: Greedily pair the heaviest person with the lightest person who fits (maximizing boat utilization); if no one fits alongside, the heaviest rides alone—sorting makes this a single-pass two-pointer scan.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting dominates; the two-pointer scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Three integers (left, right, boat count) beyond the sort
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Heaviest person exceeds limit alone (boats still counted), everyone fits in pairs (N/2 boats), single person, all people at the same weight, lightest + heaviest exactly equals limit
