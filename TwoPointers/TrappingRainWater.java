/**
 * 42. Trapping Rain Water
 * Difficulty: Hard | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Stack, Monotonic Stack
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Pointer Water-Level Sweep
 * Key insight: At each step the shorter-side bar is the bottleneck—water above it is determined by its own historical
 * max and the opposite side's max, so advancing the shorter pointer is always safe and avoids needing precomputed
 * leftMax/rightMax arrays.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each pointer advances at most N steps; single pass with no nested loops
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only four variables (left, right, leftMax, rightMax) regardless of input size
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Fewer than 3 bars (zero water), monotonic ascending/descending heights, plateaus where left ==
 * right height, all bars at equal height
