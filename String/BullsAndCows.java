/**
 * 299. Bulls and Cows
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Hash Table, String, Counting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/
 *
 * Pattern: Hash Map Frequency Counting (Two Pass)
 * Key insight: Bulls (exact position matches) are counted first and removed from the secret's
 * frequency map so they are never re-counted as cows later. A cow is any guess digit still present
 * in the remaining secret frequencies but at the wrong position; decrementing the map on each match
 * guarantees every secret digit is paired at most once, preventing double counting.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass to build the frequency map plus two linear scans over the guess, all backed by O(1) hash map operations.
 * Space Complexity: O(K) - Frequency map; K = distinct characters (bounded by 10 digits per constraints, so effectively O(1)).
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: all digits match in position (bull phase empties the map, cow phase no-ops);
 * duplicate digits across secret/guess (decrements prevent re-use); empty strings yield "0A0B".
 * Honest caveat: the cow phase indexes secret.charAt(i) with guess.length(), so only safe for
 * equal-length inputs (guess longer than secret would throw IndexOutOfBounds).
