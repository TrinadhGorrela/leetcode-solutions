/**
 * 58. Length of Last Word
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: String
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
 *
 * Pattern: Split-and-Count
 * Key insight: Trim leading/trailing whitespace, split on whitespace boundaries, and return the length of the last element in the resulting array.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Trim and split each scan the string once.
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - Split array holds all words.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: trailing spaces, leading spaces, single word, multiple spaces between words
