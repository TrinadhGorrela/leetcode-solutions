/**
 * 142. Linked List Cycle II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Hash Table, Linked List, Two Pointers, Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: Floyd's Two-Phase Cycle Detection
 * Key insight: Phase 1: slow/fast meet inside the cycle. Phase 2: reset slow to head and advance both one step at a time—they meet at the cycle entry because the distance from head to entry equals the distance from the meeting point back to entry (mod cycle length).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each phase is at most O(n).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two pointers only.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no cycle (fast reaches null), cycle at the head (entry found immediately in phase 2), single-node self-loop, cycle does not include the head
