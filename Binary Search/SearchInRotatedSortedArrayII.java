/**
 * 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Binary Search
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search (Rotated Array with Duplicates)
 * Key insight: One half of a rotated array is always sorted, so binary search can decide which half to descend into.
 * Duplicates break the clean mid-boundary comparison, so when all three of left, mid, and right are equal, shrink both
 * endpoints by one to break the tie and continue; correctness holds because the target, if present, stays inside the
 * remaining range.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log N) on average, but O(N) worst case - The shrink-by-one tie-breaking can degenerate to linear
 * scans when many duplicates are present (the reason rotated-sorted properties degrade).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra space is used beyond the input array.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: duplicates where all three of left/mid/right collide (handled by shrinking both ends); target at
 * either extreme of the sorted or rotated range; single-element array; target not present returns false.
