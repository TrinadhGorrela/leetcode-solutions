/**
 * 1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Binary Search, Greedy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-at-a-given-index-in-a-bounded-array/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search on Answer + Arithmetic Series
 * Key insight: Binary search the peak value at `index`; for each candidate, compute the minimal array sum by summing a
 * trapezoid-shaped decrease (max(1, peak - distance)) on each side using closed-form arithmetic series, all in long to
 * avoid overflow.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log maxSum) - Search range is [1, maxSum], each check is O(1) via formula.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only the peak candidate, two side counts, and long accumulators.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: index at array edge (one side has zero cells), peak so low that sides clamp to 1, maxSum too
 * small to place any peak (returns 1), long arithmetic prevents overflow on large n
