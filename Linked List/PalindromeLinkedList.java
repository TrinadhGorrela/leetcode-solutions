/**
 * 234. Palindrome Linked List
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Linked List, Two Pointers, Stack, Recursion
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Two Pointers (Slow/Fast) + In-Place Reversal
 * Key insight: Find the midpoint with slow/fast pointers, reverse the second half in-place,
 *   then compare both halves node-by-node — a palindrome reads the same forwards and
 *   backwards, so matching the first half against the reversed second half is sufficient.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Three linear passes (find midpoint, reverse, compare) each visit every node at most once
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a constant number of pointers are used; the second half is reversed in-place
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Single element list (trivially a palindrome); odd-length list (middle node
 *   excluded from comparison); even-length list (both halves compared fully); all-identical values;
 *   already-palindromic list; only safe for non-null input (null head causes NPE at slow.next = null)
