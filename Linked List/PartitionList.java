/**
 * 86. Partition List
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List, Two Pointers
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Two Pointers (Link Partitioning with Two Dummy Heads)
 * Key insight: Because each node is detached from the input and appended to a "small" or "large" chain by comparing its value with x, relative order inside both partitions is preserved; splicing the small chain onto the large chain rebuilds a stable partition with no swaps.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Single pass over the list; every node is processed exactly once
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only two constant dummy sentinel nodes are allocated; no data nodes are created
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null/empty list (loop is skipped, a null tail is returned); all nodes < x or all nodes >= x (one chain stays empty and the join still succeeds); single node; duplicate values (stable ordering is kept)
