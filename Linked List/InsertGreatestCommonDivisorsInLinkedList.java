/**
 * 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List, Math, Number Theory
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-greatest-common-divisors-in-linked-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Linked List Insertion + Euclidean Algorithm (GCD)
 * Key insight: The GCD of two numbers equals GCD(b, a mod b), so Euclid's algorithm shrinks the remainder until it reaches 0, giving the answer in O(log min(a,b)). Threading that value between every adjacent pair via pointer rewiring completes the insertion in one pass.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log M) - The Euclidean algorithm runs in O(log M) per adjacent pair (M = max node value), applied over N - 1 pairs.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a few pointers; the inserted nodes are the required output, no auxiliary collection.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Single-node list (loop body is skipped and the original head is returned), adjacent equal values (GCD equals the value itself), and coprime neighbors (GCD = 1). Does not guard against a null head, which the constraints rule out.
