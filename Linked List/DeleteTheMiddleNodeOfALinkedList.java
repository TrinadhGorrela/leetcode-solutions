/**
 * 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List, Two Pointers
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Two Pointers (Slow/Fast) + Sentinel Dummy
 * Key insight: Because fast advances exactly twice as fast as slow, slow lands on the middle node the moment fast falls off the end; the dummy pointer trails slow by one node and therefore always marks the middle's predecessor, letting the node be relinked around in a single assignment.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass; fast covers the whole list in about N/2 iterations
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra pointers are used
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single node (returns null); two-node list (the head is the second middle and is unlinked via the sentinel); even-length lists (the second of the two middle nodes is deleted per the problem definition, verified for lengths 2 and 4). Does not guard a null head - head.next would throw NPE - but the constraints guarantee a non-empty list.
