/**
 * 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List, Simulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/
 *
 * Pattern: Single Pass Linked List Traversal (Running Sum Simulation)
 * Key insight: Each 0, except the skipped head, closes a running-sum window, so a single pass that adds values and resets the sum to 0 on every 0 produces every merged node in order. This holds because each segment is bracketed by zeros and accumulated independently.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One traversal of the list, visiting each node exactly once.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a dummy node and an integer accumulator; the result list is required output, not auxiliary storage.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: List of two zeros (yields a single 0 node), consecutive zeros (produce a 0-valued node), a single segment between the leading and trailing zero, and the trailing zero (finalizes the last segment). Relies on the constraint that the list begins with a zero, since head is skipped without checking its value.
