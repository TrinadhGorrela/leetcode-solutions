/**
 * 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Value Overwrite (Copy-and-Skip Deletion)
 * Key insight: Since we only have the target node (no predecessor), we copy the next node's value
 * into it and bypass the next node. The problem guarantees the target is never the tail, so next always exists.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant-time: two assignments plus one pointer redirect.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place mutation, no auxiliary structures.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: node.next is guaranteed non-null by LeetCode (node is never the tail).
 * Note: would throw NullPointerException if called on the last node, which the constraints forbid.
