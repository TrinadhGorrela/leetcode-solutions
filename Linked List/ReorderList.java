/**
 * 143. Reorder List
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Linked List, Two Pointers, Stack, Recursion
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/
 *
 * Pattern: Two Pointers (Slow/Fast) + In-Place Reversal + Merge
 * Key insight: Find the midpoint with slow/fast pointers, reverse the second half in-place, then interleave-merge the two halves. Because the second half is detached at the midpoint, no extra nodes are needed.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Three linear passes: find midpoint, reverse second half, merge.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - All operations are in-place; only a handful of pointers used.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single node (loop bodies never execute, head returned as-is), two nodes (midpoint split produces one reversed node, merge interleaves correctly), odd-length list (slow lands on true middle, right half has one fewer node).
