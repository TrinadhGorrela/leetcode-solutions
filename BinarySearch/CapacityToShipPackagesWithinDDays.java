/**
 * 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Binary Search
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search on Answer
 * Key insight: The search space for capacity is [max(weights), sum(weights)]; for each candidate capacity, a greedy
 * left-to-right scan packs as many packages as possible per day and counts whether days suffice.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n log W) - n = number of packages, W = sum of weights; each feasibility check is O(n).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only load accumulator and day counter.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single package (capacity = its weight), all packages fit in one day, capacity must equal heaviest
 * single package minimum, days exactly equal to number of packages
