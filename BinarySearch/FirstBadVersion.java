/**
 * 278. First Bad Version
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Binary Search, Interactive
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search (Lower Bound)
 * Key insight: Versions form a monotonic [good...good, bad...bad] sequence; when mid is bad, set end = mid (it could be the first bad); when mid is good, set start = mid + 1 (first bad is strictly after). Converges when start == end.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) - Interval halves each step.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two pointers: start, end.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1, first version is bad (start never advances past 1), last version is first bad, all versions good
