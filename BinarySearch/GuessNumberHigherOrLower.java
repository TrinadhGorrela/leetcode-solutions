/**
 * 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Binary Search, Interactive
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/
 *
 * Pattern: Interactive Binary Search
 * Key insight: The guess() API returns -1 (too high), 1 (too low), or 0 (found); use these as the comparison to halve [left, right] each iteration until the exact number is narrowed down.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) - Interval halves each guess.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Three integers: left, right, mid.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 (returned immediately), picked number at boundary (1 or n), picked number is the initial midpoint
