/**
 * 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Binary Search
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search (Rotated Array)
 * Key insight: The minimum is located at the rotation point, the only position where a value dips below its predecessor.
 * Comparing the midpoint against the left boundary reveals which side the pivot lies on: because the array is sorted
 * apart from one rotation, the unsorted (smaller-value) half always contains the minimum.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log N) - Each iteration halves the search space via the monotonic boundary comparison.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra space is used.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: array rotated -K times (minimum equals the pivot element); already sorted array with no rotation
 * (leftmost element is the min); single-element array; result initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE covers all valid
 * rotated inputs of length >= 1.
