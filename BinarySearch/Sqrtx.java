/**
 * 69. Sqrt(x)
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Binary Search, Newton's Method
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search on Integer Square Root
 * Key insight: Search [1, x] for the largest mid where mid ≤ x / mid (equivalent to mid² ≤ x but avoids overflow); record the last satisfying mid as the floor square root.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log x) - Interval halves each step.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Three integers: start, end, result.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: x = 0 (early return), x = 1, perfect square (exact mid found), non-perfect square (returns floor), overflow prevented by using x/mid instead of mid*mid
