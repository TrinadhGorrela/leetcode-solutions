/**
 * 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Binary Search, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Search on the Answer (Greedy Feasibility Check)
 * Key insight: If a minimum force of d is feasible, then any force less than d is also feasible (monotonicity), so the
 * answer space can be binary searched. For each candidate force, a greedy linear scan places balls from left to right
 * only when the gap meets the threshold; if all m balls are placed, the candidate is feasible.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log R) where R is the coordinate range (position[N-1] - position[0]) - Sorting costs O(N log N);
 * the binary search executes O(log R) iterations, each with an O(N) feasibility scan.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra space is used beyond the input array.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: m == 2 (binary search over full range, returning the maximum possible gap); m equals array length
 * (every position used, minimum gap equals the min of adjacent sorted gaps); all positions equal (zero range, force 0
 * always returned); unsorted input (sorted at the start before binary search).
