/**
 * 135. Candy
 * Difficulty: Hard | Tags: Array, Greedy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Pass Greedy with Max Merge
 * Key insight: A single pass can only enforce one neighbor constraint at a time; two passes (left-to-right for ascending runs, right-to-left for descending runs) independently set lower bounds, and the elementwise max satisfies both simultaneously.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Three linear passes: forward, backward, and sum
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Candies array of length N
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single child (returns 1), flat ratings (all get 1), strict mountain shape (peak gets max of both slopes), equal adjacent ratings (no forced increment in either direction)
