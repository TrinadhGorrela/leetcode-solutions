/**
 * 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-pass-ratio/
 *
 * Pattern: Greedy Max-Heap on Marginal Gain
 * Key insight: Each extra student should go to the class where adding them yields the largest delta in pass ratio:
 * `(pass+1)/(total+1) - pass/total`. A max-heap on this gain ensures each assignment is locally optimal; reinsert with
 * updated gain after each allocation.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O((N + E) log N) - Build heap O(N), then E heap operations of O(log N) each
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Heap stores one entry per class
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: extraStudents = 0 (no heap pops), class with 100% pass rate (gain approaches 0, naturally
 * deprioritized), single class (all students go there), large E with small N (heap churn but correct)
