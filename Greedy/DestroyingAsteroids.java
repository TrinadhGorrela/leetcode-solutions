/**
 * 2126. Destroying Asteroids
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Greedy, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/destroying-asteroids/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort-and-Absorb Greedy
 * Key insight: Sorting ensures we always absorb the smallest reachable asteroid first, monotonically increasing mass so larger ones become reachable; if any asteroid exceeds current mass, all subsequent (larger) ones will too — immediate failure.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting dominates; the absorption scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Single long accumulator for mass (long avoids int overflow)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: asteroid larger than starting mass (first-or-early fail), all asteroids absorbable (mass grows monotonically), mass sum exceeding int range (long prevents overflow), single asteroid smaller than mass
