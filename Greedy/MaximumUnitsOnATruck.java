/**
 * 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Greedy, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/
 *
 * Pattern: Fractional Knapsack (Greedy by Value Density)
 * Key insight: Since partial boxes are allowed, the optimal strategy is purely greedy: always fill from the
 * highest-unit-per-box type first. The only decision point is the last (possibly partial) batch when capacity runs out.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sort by unit count descending; single scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Accumulator plus loop variables (sort in place)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: truckSize = 0 (returns 0), fewer total boxes than capacity (all loaded), exact capacity match
 * with no partial box, single box type filling the entire truck
