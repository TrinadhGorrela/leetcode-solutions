/**
 * 1288. Remove Covered Intervals
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort-then-Scan Cover Detection
 * Key insight: Sorting by ascending start (and descending end for ties) ensures the widest interval for a given start
 * is encountered first; a subsequent interval is covered if it falls within the last kept interval's bounds (start ≥
 * kept.start && end ≤ kept.end).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Custom sort dominates; linear scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Index pointer and count; sort modifies in place
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: identical intervals (second is covered), same start different end (longer one kept first),
 * partial overlaps (not covered, new kept interval set), fully nested intervals (inner removed)
