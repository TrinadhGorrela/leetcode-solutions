/**
 * 2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Counting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks/
 *
 * Pattern: Counting + Ceil-Division Greedy
 * Key insight: Since each round processes 2 or 3 tasks, the minimum rounds for count c is ⌈c/3⌉ — a count of 1 is impossible (returns -1), while counts ≥ 2 are always solvable because the remainder after dividing by 3 is always coverable by 2s.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass to count frequencies, one pass over unique levels
 * Space Complexity: O(U) - HashMap with U unique task levels
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: any level with count 1 (impossible, returns -1), count divisible by 3 (exact ⌈c/3⌉), count mod 3 = 1 (requires one fewer 3-group and one more 2-group), single unique level
