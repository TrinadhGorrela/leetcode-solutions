/**
 * 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/
 *
 * Pattern: End-Time Greedy Interval Scheduling
 * Key insight: Sorting by end time and always keeping the earliest-finishing non-overlapping interval maximizes the number of kept intervals (classic interval scheduling optimality). Removals = N - kept, so minimizing removals is equivalent to maximizing kept.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sort by end time dominates; the scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two tracking variables (last end, keptCount)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single interval (0 removals), all overlapping (all but one removed), touching boundaries (start >= last end means non-overlapping, kept), intervals sorted by start not end (sorting corrects this)
