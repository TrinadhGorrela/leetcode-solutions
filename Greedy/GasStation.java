/**
 * 134. Gas Station
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Greedy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Pass Greedy Feasibility Check
 * Key insight: A circular tour is possible only when total gas >= total cost; within that guarantee, any prefix deficit
 * proves every station in that prefix is an invalid start, so resetting to the next station after a deficit is
 * sufficient.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Two linear passes: one for the total check, one for the start selection
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Four integer accumulators (totalGas, totalCost, start, curr)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: total gas < total cost (returns -1 immediately), all stations deficit-free (returns 0), single
 * station with gas >= cost, deficit resets mid-tour pushing start to the correct answer
