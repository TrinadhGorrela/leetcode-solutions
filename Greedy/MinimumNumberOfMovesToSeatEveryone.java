/**
 * 2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Greedy, Sorting, Counting Sort
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort-and-Pair Optimal Matching
 * Key insight: By the rearrangement inequality, pairing the i-th smallest student with the i-th smallest seat minimizes the sum of absolute displacements — sorting both arrays and taking elementwise differences is both necessary and sufficient.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Two sorts dominate; the difference scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place sorts and scalar accumulator
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: all students already in their seats (total moves = 0), single student, identical seat positions, students and seats in completely reversed order
