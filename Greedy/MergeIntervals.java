/**
 * 56. Merge Intervals
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Sorting, Quicksort
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort-by-Start Linear Merge
 * Key insight: Sorting by start time guarantees that any overlap with the running merged interval is detected by comparing `lastEnd >= currentStart`; the merged interval's end simply extends to `max(lastEnd, currentEnd)`, otherwise the interval is disjoint and gets appended.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting dominates; the merge scan is O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Output list may hold up to N intervals (no overlaps case); auxiliary sort space not counted
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: fully contained intervals (end extends via max), adjacent intervals touching at boundary (merged), single interval (output equals input), all overlapping (single merged interval in output)
