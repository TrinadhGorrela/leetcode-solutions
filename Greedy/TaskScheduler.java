/**
 * 621. Task Scheduler
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Counting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/
 *
 * Pattern: Greedy Counting (Math Formula)
 * Key insight: The bottleneck is the most frequent task. Placing (maxFreq - 1) chunks of size (n + 1) creates the required cooldown gaps; adding the count of tasks sharing maxFreq fills the final chunk. The answer is the maximum of this formula and the total task count (when there are enough distinct tasks to fill every slot with no idle time).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Single pass over the task array to compute frequencies and track max; N = number of tasks
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Fixed-size frequency array of 26 elements regardless of input size
 *
 * * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 (no cooldown, answer is just task count); single task type; all tasks are the same type; more distinct task types than cooldown slots (no idle needed); empty task array
