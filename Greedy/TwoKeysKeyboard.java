/**
 * 650. 2 Keys Keyboard
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Dynamic Programming
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/
 *
 * Pattern: Trial-Division Prime Factorization
 * Key insight: Building n characters from 1 requires copy-paste operations whose count equals the sum of n's prime
 * factors (with multiplicity). Each factor p corresponds to one copy + (p-1) pastes = p operations; trial division from
 * 2 upward extracts these factors efficiently.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(√n) - Trial division loops up to √n; after dividing out all small factors, at most one large prime
 * remains
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two integer variables (steps, factors)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 (returns 0, no operations needed), prime n (single factor = n itself, returns n), n = 4
 * (2+2 = 4 operations, optimal copy-paste-copy-paste), composite like 12 = 2×2×3 (returns 7)
