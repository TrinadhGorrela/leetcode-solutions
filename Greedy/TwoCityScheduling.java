/**
 * 1029. Two City Scheduling
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Greedy, Sorting, Hungarian Algorithm, Successive Shortest Path Algorithm
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/
 *
 * Pattern: Cost-Difference Sorting Greedy
 * Key insight: The difference (costA - costB) captures how much cheaper city A is relative to B; sorting by this
 * difference and sending the first half to A (biggest A advantage) and second half to B minimizes total cost under the
 * N/2 split constraint.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting N people by cost difference dominates
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Auxiliary sortedCosts array storing the difference as a third column
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: exactly 2 people (one sent to each), all differences equal (arbitrary but valid split), costA ==
 * costB for all (difference 0, any assignment yields the same total)
