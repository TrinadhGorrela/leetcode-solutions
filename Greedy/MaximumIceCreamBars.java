/**
 * 1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Greedy, Sorting, Counting Sort
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-ice-cream-bars/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort-Ascending Greedy Selection
 * Key insight: Every unit of coin spent on a cheaper bar "frees up" capacity for more bars than spending on an expensive one; sorting ascending and taking greedily maximizes the total count — this is the unbounded subset-sum optimality for unit-profit items.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Sorting dominates; the scan is O(N) with early termination
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Running counters (coins, count) plus in-place sort
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: zero coins (returns 0 immediately), can afford all bars (count = N), coins exhausted mid-array (loop continues but condition fails), all bars same price
