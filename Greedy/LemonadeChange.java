/**
 * 860. Lemonade Change
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Greedy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/
 *
 * Pattern: Fixed-Denomination Greedy Change-Making
 * Key insight: Only $5 and $10 bills accumulate (used as change); a $20 payment is best served by one $10 + one $5
 * (preserves more $5s for future), falling back to three $5s — this greedy preference is optimal because $10 bills are
 * useless as change for $5-only scenarios.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Single pass; constant work per bill
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two counters (fiveCount, tenCount)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: first customer with $10 or $20 (no change possible, returns false), sequence requiring $10+$5
 * path for $20 (preserves fiveCount), customer paying $20 when only three $5s available (last-resort path)
