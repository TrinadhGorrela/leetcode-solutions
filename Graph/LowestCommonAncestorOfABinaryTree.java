/**
 * 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree, Binary Lifting, Lowest Common Ancestor
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
 *
 * Pattern: Recursive DFS (Post-Order) with Two-Match Return
 * Key insight: The LCA is the deepest node at which both p and q exist in opposite subtrees. A post-order traversal
 * returns the first node matching either p or q's value upward; if both children return non-null, the current node is
 * the LCA—this holds because any match in the left subtree is an ancestor (or a child) of p, and the same for q.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Every node is visited exactly once.
 * Space Complexity: O(H) - Recursion stack depth equals tree height H (O(log N) balanced, O(N) degenerate).
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null root (returns null); one node is ancestor of the other (the ancestor node is found first
 * and propagated upward); p and q are in opposite subtrees at depth 2 (parent returned immediately); single-node tree
 * (returns null if neither target is present).
