/**
 * 133. Clone Graph
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Hash Table, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/
 *
 * Pattern: DFS with Memoization Map
 * Key insight: Clone each node on first visit and store it in a value-keyed map. When DFS encounters a neighbor already in the map, it reuses the existing clone instead of creating a duplicate, which both breaks cycles and avoids redundant work. The map serves as both a visited set and a clone registry.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) - Each node cloned once; each edge traversed once to link neighbors
 * Space Complexity: O(V) - HashMap stores V cloned nodes; recursion stack up to V deep
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null input node (returns null immediately), self-loop (map lookup returns the node's own clone), cycle in graph (map prevents infinite recursion), single isolated node with no neighbors (cloned with empty neighbor list)
