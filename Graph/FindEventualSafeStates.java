 * 802. Find Eventual Safe States
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Kosaraju's Algorithm, Tarjan's SCC Algorithm
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/
 *
 * Pattern: DFS Cycle Detection (Three-State Marking)
 * Key insight: Each node is in one of three states: unvisited, on the current recursion path (recPath), or resolved. If DFS encounters a node still on the recursion path, a cycle exists and the current branch is unsafe. A node is marked safe only after all its descendants are confirmed safe (recursion unwinds without detecting a cycle).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) - Each node and edge processed once; visited array prevents redundant DFS calls
 * Space Complexity: O(V) - Three boolean arrays (visited, recPath, safe) of size V; recursion stack up to V deep
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: terminal nodes with no outgoing edges (immediately safe), nodes on a cycle (recPath back-edge detection marks entire cycle unsafe), self-loop (immediate cycle detection), disconnected components (each DFS call starts from unvisited node)
