/**
 * 841. Keys and Rooms
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/
 *
 * Pattern: BFS Reachability from Source Node
 * Key insight: Model rooms as nodes and keys as directed edges; BFS from room 0 explores the reachable subgraph. If the visited set covers all n rooms, every room is reachable. Keys in already-visited rooms are redundant and skipped.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N + E) - N rooms visited at most once; E is total number of keys across all rooms
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - Visited boolean array and BFS queue each hold at most N entries
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single room (room 0 opens itself, returns true), room with no keys (dead end, no neighbors enqueued), unreachable room in a disconnected component (returns false)
