/**
 * 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

 * Ancestor

 *
 * Pattern: BST Traversal (Exploiting BST Invariant)
 * Key insight: In a BST all nodes in the left subtree are smaller and all in the right subtree are larger, so the LCA
 * is the first node where p and q diverge to different subtrees—or the node itself if one equals root. Walking left when
 * both are smaller and right when both are larger converges on the LCA in O(h) time.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(h) where h is the tree height - O(log N) on a balanced BST; O(N) worst case if degenerate.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - An iterative pointer walk with no recursion or auxiliary data structures.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: p or q equals the root (returned immediately as LCA); both nodes lie in the same subtree and the
 * tree is degenerate (traversal walks down a single chain); null root (returns null).
