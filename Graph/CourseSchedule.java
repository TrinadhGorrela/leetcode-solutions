 * 207. Course Schedule
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Directed Acyclic Graph
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
 *
 * Pattern: DFS Cycle Detection in Directed Graph
 * Key insight: Build the prerequisite graph as a DAG check: if DFS encounters a node currently on the recursion stack (recPath), a back edge exists meaning a cycle is present and scheduling is impossible. Nodes fully explored are marked visited to avoid redundant traversal across disconnected components.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) - Each course and prerequisite edge visited once across all DFS calls
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E) - Adjacency list for E edges; visited and recPath arrays of size V; recursion stack up to V deep
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no prerequisites (vacuously acyclic, returns true), cycle detection via recPath back-edge (returns false), disconnected prerequisite graph (outer loop starts DFS from each unvisited course), single course with no prerequisites (returns true)
