/**
 * 283. Move Zeroes
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Two Pointers
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/
 *
 * Pattern: Stable In-Place Zero Partition
 * Key insight: Swapping each non-zero to the write pointer's position (instead of just overwriting) preserves the
 * relative order of non-zero elements—a critical constraint that distinguishes this from an unstable partition.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass; writeIndex only advances, never retreats
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two index variables and one temp, in-place on input array
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: No zeros in array (swap is identity), all zeros (no swaps execute), leading zeros, trailing
 * zeros, zeros interleaved with non-zeros throughout
