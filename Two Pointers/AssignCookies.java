/**
 * 455. Assign Cookies
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Greedy, Sorting, Quicksort
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
 *
 * Pattern: Sort + Greedy Cookie-to-Child Matching
 * Key insight: After sorting both arrays, a single forward scan matches the smallest sufficient cookie to each child in
 * order—any cookie too small for the current child is also too small for all remaining children.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N + M log M) - Sorting both arrays dominates; the merge scan is O(N+M)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Three integers (two pointers + count) beyond the sort
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: No cookies (0 satisfied), no children (0 satisfied), all cookies too small, all cookies large
 * enough (min(g) matched), oversized cookies leftover unused
