/**
 * 3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-substring-with-two-occurrences/
 *
 * Pattern: Variable Sliding Window with Per-Character Frequency Cap (max 2)
 * Key insight: Grow the window rightward, incrementing each character's count in a map. When any character's count exceeds 2, shrink from the left (decrementing and advancing) until that character is back to exactly 2. The window is always valid after the while loop, so record its length.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Right advances once per iteration; left advances at most N times total; each map operation is O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - HashMap holds at most 26 lowercase letters
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single character string (result 1), all same character (capped at 2), all distinct characters (full string length), third occurrence of any character triggers left advancement
