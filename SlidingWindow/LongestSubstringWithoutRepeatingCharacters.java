/**
 * 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
 *
 * Pattern: Sliding Window with HashSet (First-Occurrence Erasure)
 * Key insight: When a duplicate is found at right, the set may contain many characters between left and the previous occurrence of s[right]. Rather than tracking positions, simply advance left one-by-one removing from the set until the duplicate is gone. Each character is added and removed at most once, keeping O(N).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Right advances N times; left advances at most N times total; HashSet ops are O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(min(N, alphabet)) - Set holds at most the size of the character set (26 lowercase, 128 ASCII, etc.)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: empty string (returns 0), single character (returns 1), all identical characters (window size stays 1), all unique characters (window spans entire string), duplicate at the very start of the window
