/**
 * 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/
 *
 * Pattern: Variable Sliding Window (At Most k Zeros)
 * Key insight: Count zeros in the window; when the count exceeds k, advance left until a zero is evicted, restoring the
 * budget. The window represents a subarray that can be fully converted to ones by flipping at most k zeros. Track the
 * maximum window length throughout.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Right pointer scans once; left pointer advances at most N times total
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Three integer scalars (left, max, count) with no heap or map
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k = 0 (no flips, answer is the longest existing run of 1s), all zeros (answer is k if k <= N),
 * all ones (answer is N), k >= total zero count (entire array is flippable)
