/**
 * 485. Max Consecutive Ones
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/
 *
 * Pattern: Linear Scan with Run-Length Counter
 * Key insight: Increment a counter on each 1 and reset it to 0 on each 0, taking the max after every element. The final max() call after the loop handles a trailing run of ones that never encounters a 0 to trigger the mid-loop max update.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Single pass through the array
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Two integer scalars (count, max)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: all zeros (count never exceeds 0), all ones (final max() after loop captures the full run), single element (1 or 0), leading zeros followed by ones, trailing ones with no terminating 0
