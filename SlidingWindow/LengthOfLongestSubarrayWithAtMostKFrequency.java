/**
 * 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/
 *
 * Pattern: Variable Sliding Window with Frequency Constraint (max k per element)
 * Key insight: Expand right, incrementing each element's frequency in a map. When nums[right]'s frequency exceeds k, shrink from the left (decrementing and advancing) until that specific element's count returns to exactly k. Only the triggering element needs correction, not all elements.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Right advances once per iteration; left advances at most N times total; each HashMap operation is O(1) amortized
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - HashMap holds frequency counts for up to N distinct elements
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k = 0 with any repeating element (window collapses to 0), single element (result 1), one element repeated > k times (window bounded by k occurrences), all distinct elements (entire array is valid)
