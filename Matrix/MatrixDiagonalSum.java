/**
 * 1572. Matrix Diagonal Sum
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Matrix
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/
 *
 * Pattern: Dual-Diagonal Accumulation
 * Key insight: A cell belongs to the primary diagonal (i == j) or the anti-diagonal (i + j == n−1); on odd n, the
 * center cell satisfies both conditions and is counted only once thanks to the `||` (not double-add).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n²) - Double loop over the full matrix; could be O(n) with direct diagonal indexing.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Running sum only.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: 1×1 matrix (center counted once), odd n (shared center), even n (no overlap)
