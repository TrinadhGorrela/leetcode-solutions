/**
 * 1049. Last Stone Weight II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming, Knapsack Problem, 0-1 Knapsack
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: 0-1 Knapsack (Partition DP)
 * Key insight: Smashing stones is equivalent to splitting them into two groups and minimizing the absolute difference of their sums. By finding the maximum achievable sum up to total/2 using a 0-1 knapsack, the answer is total - 2 * best, which is the minimum possible leftover weight.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N * S) where S = sum/2 - Two nested loops over N stones and S capacity values
 * Space Complexity: O(N * S) - 2D DP array of dimensions (N+1) x (S+1)
 *
 * * Edge Cases Handled: single stone (returns its own weight); two equal stones (return 0); all stones the same weight; total sum is odd (target floors to floor(sum/2))
