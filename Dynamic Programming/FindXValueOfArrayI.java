/**
 * 3524. Find X Value of Array I
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Math, Dynamic Programming
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-x-value-of-array-i/
 *
 * Pattern: Dynamic Programming (Mod-k Remainder DP)
 * Key insight: When counting subsequences by the product of their elements mod k, only the remainder matters, so state collapses into k buckets: each new element extends every previously counted subsequence, and remainders compose as (j * nums[i]) % k with a single-element subsequence added for itself.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N * K) - N elements, each scans all k remainder buckets to build the next count set.
 * Space Complexity: O(K) - Uses three count arrays (current, previous, total) that each scale with k.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: empty input (returns an all-zero array), single element, k = 1 (every remainder collapses to 0), and int overflow avoided by promoting intermediate products to long. Note: assumes non-negative nums[i] per constraints, since a negative remainder would index out of bounds.
