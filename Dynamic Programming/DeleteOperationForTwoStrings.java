/**
 * 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: String, Dynamic Programming, Longest Common Subsequence
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/
 *
 * Pattern: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
 * Key insight: The minimum deletions to make two strings equal equals len(word1) + len(word2) - 2 × LCS.
 *   This holds because we keep the longest shared subsequence and delete everything else from both strings.
 *   Standard 2D LCS DP computes dp[i][j] = length of LCS of word1[0..i) and word2[0..j).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(M * N) — DP table of size (M+1) × (N+1) with constant work per cell
 * Space Complexity: O(M * N) — 2D DP array stores LCS lengths for all prefix pairs
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: one or both strings empty (LCS = 0, returns sum of lengths),
 *   strings already equal (LCS = min length, returns difference of lengths),
 *   completely disjoint character sets (LCS = 0)
