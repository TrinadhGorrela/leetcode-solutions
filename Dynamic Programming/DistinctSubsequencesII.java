/**
 * 940. Distinct Subsequences II
 * Difficulty: Hard | Tags: String, Dynamic Programming
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: Dynamic Programming (Counting with Last-Occurrence Dedup)
 * Key insight: The number of distinct subsequences ending with character c is maintained, and when c recurs, the newly generated subsequences that duplicated the previous set ending with c must be subtracted. By storing end[index] (subsequences already finishing with this letter) and subtracting it, we avoid double-counting identical subsequences that end with the same character.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass over the string with O(1) per character (constant 26-letter alphabet).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - A fixed 26-element array tracks the per-letter subsequence counts.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single-character string (yields exactly 1 subsequence); repeated/all-same characters (deduplication via end[index] keeps the count at N not 2^N); large counts overflowing int (modulo 1_000_000_007 with + MOD to keep subtraction non-negative); empty string (loop never runs, returns 0).
