/**
 * 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Dynamic Programming, Combinatorics, Prefix Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sets-of-k-non-overlapping-line-segments/
 *
 * Pattern: Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Memoized DFS) with a (position, segments remaining, currently drawing) state.
 * Key insight: At each point the three choices - skip, start/extend, or finish a segment - are encoded by the isDrawing flag, which enforces that once a segment is closed the next one must start later, guaranteeing non-overlap. Each state transition is O(1), so memoizing the n*k*2 states eliminates repeated subproblem work.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N*K) - at most N*(K+1)*2 distinct states, each computed in O(1).
 * Space Complexity: O(N*K) - the Integer[n][k+1][2] memo table, plus recursion depth up to N on the call stack.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: k == 0 returns 1 immediately with no segments drawn; running out of points (i >= n) with segments still pending returns 0 (e.g. n == 1 with k >= 1) before any dp index access, avoiding out-of-bounds reads; all sums are taken modulo 1_000_000_007 to keep results within int range.
