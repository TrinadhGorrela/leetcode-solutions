/**
 * 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/
 *
 * Pattern: Sliding Window (Variable Length) + Hash Map
 * Key insight: Maintain a window where (window length - most-frequent character count) <= k. Because maxFreq is never decreased (only overwritten when a new maximum appears), the window only grows, ensuring correctness without backtracking.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each character is visited once by the right pointer; left pointer advances at most N times total.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Hash map holds at most 26 uppercase-letter entries.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single character string (returns 1), k = 0 (window must already be uniform), all distinct characters (window shrinks to 1 when k < 1), k >= string length (entire string is the answer).
