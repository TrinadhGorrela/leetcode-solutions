/**
 * 2904. Shortest and Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: String, Sliding Window
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-and-lexicographically-smallest-beautiful-string/
 *
 * Pattern: Variable Sliding Window with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking
 * Key insight: Expand right to accumulate exactly k ones; once reached, record the candidate and shrink left to find
 * shorter windows. When two windows tie in length, use String.compareTo to keep the lexicographically smaller one.
 * Shrinking always produces shorter or equal candidates, so the first tie is sufficient.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each index is visited by right once and left at most once; string comparisons are bounded by
 * the current window size which is at most N
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only indices, a count, and a result string reference (output string excluded)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no valid substring exists (returns ""), k exceeds total number of ones, k = 1 with single '1' at
 * various positions, equal-length substrings resolved by lexicographic order
