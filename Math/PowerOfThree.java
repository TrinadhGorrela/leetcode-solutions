/**
 * 326. Power of Three
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Recursion
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/
 *
 * Pattern: Repeated Multiplication (Incremental Power Construction)
 * Key insight: Start at 3^0 = 1 and multiply by 3 until the running power reaches or exceeds n; return true only if it
 * lands exactly on n.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log_3 n) - Each iteration multiplies the power by 3, up to the largest power of 3 that fits in an
 * int
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only power and isPower flags
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 (3^0, matched on the first iteration), non-powers of 3 (loop exits once power exceeds n and
 * isPower stays false), n values beyond the largest representable power of 3
