/**
 * 1518. Water Bottles
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Simulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/
 *
 * Pattern: Iterative Bottle Exchange (Fixed Exchange Rate)
 * Key insight: Each round, divide current bottles by numExchange to get newly drinkable bottles, then fold in the modulo remainder as leftover empties; repeat until the batch is too small to exchange.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log_{numExchange}(numBottles)) - Bottles shrink by roughly the exchange rate each iteration
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only three int variables (res, t, numBottles)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: exact multiples of numExchange (remainder = 0, no leftovers folded in), numBottles < numExchange on first iteration (returns initial count immediately)
