/**
 * 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/
 *
 * Pattern: Arithmetic Counting (Prefix Formula, No Iteration)
 * Key insight: The number of odd integers up to x is (x + 1) / 2; the count in [low, high] is prefix(high) - prefix(low
 * - 1), computed in O(1) via the low / 2 and (high + 1) / 2 closed forms.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant number of arithmetic operations
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only the two prefix-count variables
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: low == high (single number), even or odd values at either endpoint, low = 0 (prefix up to -1 is
 * correctly 0), full range boundaries
