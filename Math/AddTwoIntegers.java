/**
 * 2235. Add Two Integers
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-integers/
 *
 * Pattern: Direct Arithmetic Expression
 * Key insight: The sum of two ints is returned by a single + expression; no special logic is required since the Java operator handles the full range of int arithmetic directly.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - One primitive operation
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - No auxiliary state
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: both addends zero, negative addends, mixed signs, values near Integer extremes (the + operator performs two's-complement wrap naturally)
