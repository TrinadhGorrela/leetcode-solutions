/**
 * 2928. Distribute Candies Among Children I
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Combinatorics, Enumeration
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies-among-children-i/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Independent-Variable Enumeration (Complement Inference)
 * Key insight: Only the first two children need explicit loops from 0 to limit; the third child's share is derived as n - i - j, so a valid distribution is counted when that remainder is non-negative and at most limit.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(limit^2) - Two nested loops over [0, limit], independent of n
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only the res counter and loop indices
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: remaining candies for the third child negative (invalid, skipped) or exceeding limit (invalid), total candies n larger than 3 * limit (zero valid distributions), limit = 0 forcing all shares to 0
