/**
 * 509. Fibonacci Number
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Memoization
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
 *
 * Pattern: Pure Recursion (Exponential Recurrence)
 * Key insight: Express fib(n) directly as the sum fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) with base cases 0 and 1; every call re-expands
 * into two subproblems, so no result is memoized and the work grows exponentially.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n) - The recurrence tree branches into two calls at every level
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - Maximum recursion depth is n on the call stack
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 and n = 1 as terminating base cases, large n where the exponential blow-up dominates
