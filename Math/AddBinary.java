/**
 * 67. Add Binary
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, String, Bit Manipulation, Simulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/
 *
 * Pattern: Right-to-Left Bitwise Addition with Carry
 * Key insight: Iterate both strings from their least significant bits while either string has an unread bit or a carry remains; per position, sum the inbound carry with each available bit, append sum % 2, and carry sum / 2 forward. Reverse the builder at the end since bits are emitted in reverse order.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(max(len(a), len(b))) - One pass over the longer string; final carry adds at most one extra iteration
 * Space Complexity: O(max(len(a), len(b))) - StringBuilder accumulates one char per result bit
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: final carry of 1 after both strings are exhausted (loop continues while carry == 1, appending the extra high bit), unequal string lengths (shorter string's index drives i/j below 0 and is skipped), all-zero operands (single '0' appended), single-bit strings
