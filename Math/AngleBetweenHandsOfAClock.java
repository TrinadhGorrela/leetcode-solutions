/**
 * 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/
 *
 * Pattern: Clock Angular Position Formula
 * Key insight: The hour hand sweeps 30° per hour, the minute hand 6° per minute (a relative 5.5°/min); compute the absolute degree difference and fold it into the circular range by returning min(diff, 360 - diff).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant arithmetic, no iteration
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only hour/minute angle variables
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: hour = 12 (silently folded into the hour * 30 formula as 360°, becoming 0° or a full wrap), hands exactly overlapping (angle 0), angle exactly 180 (kept as 180 by the min comparison)
