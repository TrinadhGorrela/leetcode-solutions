/**
 * 3871. Count Commas in Range II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-commas-in-range-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: Cumulative Sum over Powers-of-1000 Thresholds (Math)
 * Key insight: A number n has k commas iff it has k+1 digit groups of three. For each threshold
 *   t = 1000, 10^6, 10^9, …, every value in [t, n] contributes one additional comma, so we
 *   accumulate (n - t + 1) per qualifying tier and multiply the threshold by 1000 for the next tier.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log₁₀₀₀ n) - Loop iterates once per comma tier (at most ~7 iterations for 64-bit longs)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only two scalar variables (start and res)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n < 1000 (returns 0, no commas); n = 1000 (single iteration, result = 1);
 *   very large n near Long.MAX_VALUE (all tiers visited until threshold overflows past n)
