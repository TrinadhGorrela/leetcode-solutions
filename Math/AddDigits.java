/**
 * 258. Add Digits
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Simulation, Number Theory
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/
 *
 * Pattern: Digital Root (Modulo 9 Closed Form)
 * Key insight: Repeatedly summing a number's digits yields its digital root, expressible in closed form: 0 for n = 0, 9 when n % 9 == 0, and n % 9 otherwise — avoiding all iteration.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Single modulo check, no digit loop
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - No auxiliary data structures
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 (returned as 0, not 9), exact multiples of 9 (digit root 9, handled by the explicit check since n % 9 would give 0), single-digit n already at its root
