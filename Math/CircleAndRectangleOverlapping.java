/**
 * 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Geometry
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/circle-and-rectangle-overlapping/
 *
 * Pattern: Closest-Point Projection (Euclidean Distance)
 * Key insight: A circle overlaps a rectangle iff the distance from its center to the nearest point on the rectangle is <= radius, and that nearest point is found by clamping each center coordinate to the rectangle's bounds. Comparing squared distances avoids an expensive sqrt.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - A constant number of comparisons and arithmetic operations, independent of input size.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only a handful of local int variables.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Center inside the rectangle (clamped to itself, distance 0, always overlapping), center outside on each of the four sides and near the four corners (diagonal nearest point), and tangent contact where the circle just touches an edge or corner (uses <=).
