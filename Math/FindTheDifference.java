/**
 * 389. Find the Difference
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Hash Table, String, Bit Manipulation, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/
 *
 * Pattern: ASCII Sum Difference
 * Key insight: Sum all ASCII values of t, subtract all ASCII values of s; since t contains exactly one extra character,
 * the remainder is that character's ASCII code—no hash map needed.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Two linear passes over the strings.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Single integer accumulator.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: empty s (t has one character), extra character at any position, repeated characters (sum
 * difference still isolates the single addition)
