/**
 * 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/
 *
 * Pattern: Legendre's Formula (Counting Factor 5 Multiples)
 * Key insight: Each trailing zero needs a factor pair of (2, 5); 5 is scarcer than 2 in n!, so the total count is
 * floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... accumulated by repeatedly dividing n by 5.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log_5 n) - n is divided by 5 each iteration until it reaches 0
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only the running res accumulator
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 (loop never runs, returns 0), n < 5 (no factor of 5 present, zero trailing zeros), large n
 * where the 5^i terms naturally thin out
