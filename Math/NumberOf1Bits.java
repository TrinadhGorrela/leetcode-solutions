/**
 * 191. Number of 1 Bits
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Divide and Conquer, Bit Manipulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/
 *
 * Pattern: Bitwise Pop-Count (Shift and Mask)
 * Key insight: AND each number with 1 to test the current least significant bit, accumulate the count, then logical-shift right (>>>) so negatives are treated as unsigned 32-bit patterns.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Bounded by the fixed 32-bit width; at most 32 iterations regardless of n
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only the count accumulator
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 (zero iterations' worth of set bits), negative inputs (>>> treats sign bit as a data bit, so all 32 bits counted), n with only the sign bit set (count = 1)
