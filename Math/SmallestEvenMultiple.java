/**
 * 2413. Smallest Even Multiple
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Number Theory
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-even-multiple/
 *
 * Pattern: Parity Check (LCM with 2)
 * Key insight: The smallest even multiple of n is n itself when n is even, or 2n when n is odd — equivalent to lcm(n, 2) without explicitly computing it.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Single modulo check and possibly one multiplication
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - No auxiliary data structures
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 1 (odd, returns 2), n already even (returned unchanged), large odd n (doubled without overflow since result fits int)
