/**
 * 3100. Water Bottles II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Simulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Phase Simulation (Drink Then Exchange with Growing Rate)
 * Key insight: In each outer loop iteration, drink all full bottles at once (adding them to the total and converting to empties), then repeatedly spend empties at the current numExchange rate to buy new full bottles, incrementing the rate after every purchase.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N)) - The exchange rate grows with each trade, so total purchases are bounded by roughly sqrt(2N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only four int variables (fullBottles, empty, BottlesDrunk, numExchange)
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no empties left to exchange (outer loop exits), exchange rate grows after every single trade preventing cycles, initial numBottles = 0 (returns 0 immediately)
