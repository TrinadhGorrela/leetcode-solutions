/**
 * 836. Rectangle Overlap
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Geometry
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/
 *
 * Pattern: 1D Interval Overlap Projection (Separable Geometry)
 * Key insight: Two axis-aligned rectangles overlap if and only if their projections overlap
 *   on BOTH the x-axis and y-axis simultaneously. Project each rectangle onto each axis as a
 *   1D interval, then verify max(lefts) < min(rights) on both axes — a strict inequality
 *   ensures shared edges (touching) are not counted as overlap.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - Fixed number of comparisons and subtractions with no loops or recursion.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only a handful of local integer variables.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: Rectangles sharing only an edge/corner (touching returns false via strict >),
 *   fully contained rectangles, identical rectangles, non-overlapping on one axis only,
 *   degenerate zero-width or zero-height rectangles, negative coordinates, large coordinates.
