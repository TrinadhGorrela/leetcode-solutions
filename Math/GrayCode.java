/**
 * 89. Gray Code
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Math, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/
 *
 * Pattern: Binary Reflected Gray Code (Mirror Doubling)
 * Key insight: To extend from n-1 to n bits, iterate the existing sequence in reverse (the mirror) and add the new high bit via addition (list values + bit); the mirrored order guarantees exactly one differing bit across the reflection boundary.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n) - Sequence doubles in length each bit level; total elements = 2^n
 * Space Complexity: O(2^n) - Stores the full 2^n-element result list
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n = 0 (sequence is just [0], loop never runs), the boundary between the last original element and the first mirrored element differing in exactly one bit
