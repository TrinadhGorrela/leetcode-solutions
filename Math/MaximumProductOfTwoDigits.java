/**
 * 3536. Maximum Product of Two Digits
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Sorting
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-two-digits/
 *
 * Pattern: Two-Pass Top-K Selection (Digit Scan)
 * Key insight: Sweep the digits of n right to left while maintaining the current maximum and the runner-up (second maximum); a digit at least as large as max becomes the new max and demotes max to the runner-up.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log10 n) - One iteration per digit; at most 10 digits for an int
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only max and secondMax accumulators
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: single-digit n (secondMax stays 0, product 0), repeated equal digits (e.g., 999 -> 9 * 9), digit equal to the current max correctly bumps the runner-up (uses <= to promote)
