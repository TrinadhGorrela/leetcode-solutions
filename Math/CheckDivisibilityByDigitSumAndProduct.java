/**
 * 3622. Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/check-divisibility-by-digit-sum-and-product/
 *
 * Pattern: Digit Extraction with Simultaneous Accumulators
 * Key insight: Walk the digits via mod 10, accumulating the sum and the product in one pass, then test whether the
 * original number is divisible by (sum + product); the divisor is always positive since sum >= 1 for any n > 0 and
 * product is folded in.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log10 n) - One iteration per decimal digit
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only sum, product, temp, and digit variables
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: any digit equal to 0 (product collapses to zero but the divisor remains the sum), single-digit n
 * (sum + product = n + n... depends on digit), divisor always > 0 so modulo never divides by zero
