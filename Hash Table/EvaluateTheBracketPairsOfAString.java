/**
 * 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Hash Table, String
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-the-bracket-pairs-of-a-string/
 *
 * Pattern: Single-Pass State Machine (Flag-Guided Bracket Parsing + Hash Map Lookup)
 * Key insight: Every bracket pair is self-delimiting - '(' flips an isKey flag that
 * routes characters into a side buffer instead of the output, and the matching ')'
 * closes the pair and forces an immediate resolution. So one left-to-right scan is
 * enough: there is no need to pre-split the string, find boundaries, or maintain a
 * stack, because the delimiters tell us exactly where each key ends. Indexing
 * knowledge into a HashMap first makes every resolution an expected O(1) probe.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N + K) - N = length of s and K = total characters across all
 * knowledge entries; s is walked exactly once and each key is built/resolved once,
 * while the knowledge list is flattened into the map in a single pass.
 * Space Complexity: O(K + N) - The HashMap stores one entry per knowledge pair,
 * and the output buffer plus the key buffer together hold at most O(N) characters.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null/empty string (returns ""), string with no brackets at all
 * (copied through unchanged), adjacent pairs like "(b)(c)" (flag resets after each
 * close), single-character keys such as "(a)", keys that are prefixes of other keys
 * like "a" vs "ab" (resolved by exact delimited match, never by prefix), unknown or
 * missing knowledge entries (emit "?" per LeetCode convention), and an empty
 * knowledge list (every pair becomes "?"). Not handled: nested or unbalanced
 * brackets such as "(a(b))" and a trailing unterminated "(" key, which is silently
 * dropped since the buffer is only flushed on ')'; the task guarantees neither.
