/**
 * 41. First Missing Positive
 * Difficulty: Hard | Tags: Array, Hash Table
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/
 *
 * Pattern: HashSet + Linear Probe from 1
 * Key insight: The answer is at most n+1 (array of size n can hold at most n consecutive positives starting at 1), so
 * probing from 1 with a HashSet gives O(n) time — suboptimal space, but simple and correct.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N) - One pass to build the set, at most N+1 contains checks
 * Space Complexity: O(N) - HashSet stores all N elements
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: no positive integers in array (answer is 1), all 1..n present (answer is n+1), negatives and
 * zeros (ignored by probe), duplicates (absorbed by set)
