/**
 * 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/
 *
 * Pattern: Post-order DFS with Single-Child Guard
 * Key insight: A depth-1 leaf (both children null) is the base case; when a node has only one non-null child, skip the zero-depth null side and return 1 + the non-null child's depth, preventing a skewed tree from reporting depth 1.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Visits each node once in the worst case.
 * Space Complexity: O(h) - Recursion stack depth equals tree height.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null root returns 0, single node returns 1, left-only chain, right-only chain, perfectly balanced tree, internal node with one null child (must not be treated as leaf)
