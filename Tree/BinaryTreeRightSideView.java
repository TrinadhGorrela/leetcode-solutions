/**
 * 199. Binary Tree Right Side View
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/
 *
 * Pattern: BFS Level-Order with Last-Node Capture
 * Key insight: Snapshot the queue size for each level; the node dequeued when size reaches 1 (the final node of that
 * level) is the rightmost visible node — children are enqueued first so left/right order is preserved.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each node is enqueued and dequeued exactly once.
 * Space Complexity: O(w) - Queue holds at most one level's width of nodes.
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null root returns empty list, single node, missing right child (falls back to leftmost as
 * visible), skewed tree, complete binary tree, single-level root only
