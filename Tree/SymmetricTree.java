/**
 * 101. Symmetric Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/
 *
 * Pattern: Recursive Mirror Check
 * Key insight: Treat symmetry as a simultaneous two-pointer walk: compare left.left with right.right and left.right with right.left at every step, effectively folding the tree along its root.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each of the n nodes is visited exactly once in the paired recursion.
 * Space Complexity: O(h) - Recursion stack depth equals tree height h (log n balanced, n worst-case).
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: null root (trivially symmetric), single node, perfectly balanced tree, left-only or right-only skewed chain (asymmetric), mismatched values at mirror positions
