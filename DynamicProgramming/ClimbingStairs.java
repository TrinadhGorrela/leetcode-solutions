/**
 * 70. Climbing Stairs
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Math, Dynamic Programming, Memoization
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
 *
 * Pattern: Bottom-up 1D DP, Fibonacci recurrence
 * Key insight: ways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2] because from step i you could have arrived via a 1-step or 2-step jump, making this exactly the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Single loop from 3 to n
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - DP array of size n+1
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n<=1 returns 1 (no climbing needed); n=2 returns 2
