/**
 * 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
 * Difficulty: Easy | Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/
 *
 * Pattern: 1D bottom-up DP with free start
 * Key insight: dp[i] = min cost to reach step i from the ground; since you can start at step 0 or 1 for free, dp[0]=dp[1]=0, and each subsequent step pays the cost of the step you jumped from.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Single loop from index 2 to n
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - DP array of size n+1
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: n=2 returns 0 (both starting positions); dp[0] and dp[1] are free; answer is dp[n] not dp[n-1] since "top" is past the last step
