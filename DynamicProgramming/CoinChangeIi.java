/**
 * 518. Coin Change II
 * Difficulty: Medium | Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming, Knapsack Problem, Complete Knapsack
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/
 *
 * Pattern: 1D Complete Knapsack (combination counting)
 * Key insight: Outer-loop on coins and inner-loop on amounts ensures each combination is counted once (not permutations); dp[amt] accumulates ways to form amt by adding the current coin to all previously reachable amounts.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(coins * amount) - Each coin updates every reachable amount
 * Space Complexity: O(amount) - Single 1D array of size amount+1
 *
 * Edge Cases Handled: amount=0 returns 1 (one way: choose nothing); coins larger than current amount are naturally skipped by the loop bound
